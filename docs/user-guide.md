1. Click on the "Loan Duration (Years)" field
2. Type the number of years (for example, 5)

**Validation Rules:**

1. Click the "Calculate EMI" button
2. The system will validate your inputs
3. If valid, the monthly EMI amount will display in the Results section
4. If any input is invalid, an error message will appear indicating the issue

Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+N on your keyboard to start a new calculation.

## Understanding the Results

### Monthly EMI

The Monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed amount that the borrower will need to pay each month until the loan is fully repaid.

For example, if the calculated EMI is $483.65, the borrower will pay this exact amount every month for the entire loan duration.

![Monthly EMI Result](images/monthly-emi.png)

### Total Interest

The Total Interest is the total amount of interest that will be paid over the entire loan period.

For example, for a $25,000 loan for 5 years at 7.5% interest rate, the total interest would be $4,019.00.

This figure helps customers understand the actual cost of borrowing beyond the principal amount.

### Total Amount Payable

The Total Amount Payable is the sum of the principal amount and the total interest.

For example, if the principal is $25,000 and the total interest is $4,019.00, the total amount payable would be $29,019.00.

This represents the complete financial commitment of the loan, showing customers the full amount they will pay by the end of the loan term.

### Interest Rate Information

The application uses a fixed annual interest rate of 7.5% for all calculations. This is displayed in the detailed results view and is used as the basis for all EMI and interest calculations.

The interest is compounded monthly, meaning that interest is calculated on a monthly basis on the remaining principal amount.

## Help and Support

### Using the Help Feature

The application includes context-sensitive help for each input field:

1. Click the question mark icon [?] next to any field to view help about that specific input
2. A help tooltip will appear with information about the expected values and format
3. Click anywhere outside the tooltip to close it

## Calculation Formulas

### Compound Interest Formula

The application uses the standard compound interest formula:

**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:
- A = Final amount (principal + interest)
- P = Principal amount
- r = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)
- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year (12 for monthly)
- t = Time in years

For the bank's calculations, interest is compounded monthly (n=12) at an annual rate of 7.5% (r=0.075).

### EMI Calculation Formula

The EMI is calculated using the following formula:

**EMI = [P Ã— r Ã— (1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]**

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate Ã· 12 Ã· 100)
- n = Number of monthly installments (loan duration in years Ã— 12)

For example, with an annual interest rate of 7.5%:
- Monthly interest rate (r) = 7.5% Ã· 12 Ã· 100 = 0.00625

### Sample Calculations

**Example 1:**
- Principal Amount: $10,000
- Loan Duration: 5 years (60 months)
- Annual Interest Rate: 7.5%

**Calculation Steps:**
1. Monthly interest rate = 7.5% Ã· 12 Ã· 100 = 0.00625
2. Number of installments = 5 years Ã— 12 = 60 months
3. EMI = [$10,000 Ã— 0.00625 Ã— (1 + 0.00625)^60] Ã· [(1 + 0.00625)^60 - 1]
4. EMI = $200.38

**Example 2:**
- Principal Amount: $25,000
- Loan Duration: 3 years (36 months)
- Annual Interest Rate: 7.5%

**Calculation Steps:**
1. Monthly interest rate = 7.5% Ã· 12 Ã· 100 = 0.00625
2. Number of installments = 3 years Ã— 12 = 36 months
3. EMI = [$25,000 Ã— 0.00625 Ã— (1 + 0.00625)^36] Ã· [(1 + 0.00625)^36 - 1]
4. EMI = $777.23

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

If the application fails to start:

1. **Check Java Installation**
   - Ensure Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11 or higher is installed
   - Open a command prompt or terminal and type: `java -version`
   - If Java is not installed or the version is below 11, download and install the latest JRE from [java.com](https://java.com)

2. **Verify Installation**
   - For Windows, try reinstalling the application
   - For macOS, check if the application is in the quarantine by running: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CompoundInterestCalculator.app`
   - For Linux, check application permissions with: `ls -la /usr/bin/compound-interest-calculator`

3. **Check System Resources**
   - Ensure your computer meets the minimum system requirements
   - Close other applications to free up memory

If the issue persists, contact technical support.

### Calculation Errors

If you receive incorrect calculation results or errors during calculation:

1. **Verify Inputs**
   - Ensure all input values are within acceptable ranges
   - Check for typos in principal amount or loan duration

2. **Application Version**
   - Check that you're using the latest version of the application
   - The current version can be found in Help > About

3. **Calculation Limits**
   - Very large principal amounts (over $10 million) may cause precision issues
   - Loan durations are limited to 30 years maximum

4. **Restart the Application**
   - Close and restart the application to reset the calculation engine

### Display Issues

If the application interface doesn't display correctly:

1. **Screen Resolution**
   - Ensure your display resolution meets the minimum requirement (1024Ã—768)
   - Try adjusting your display scaling settings

2. **Font Scaling**
   - If text appears too small, adjust system font size in your operating system settings
   - Windows: Settings > Ease of Access > Display > Make text bigger
   - macOS: System Preferences > Displays > Scaled

3. **Window Size**
   - If the window appears cut off, try resizing it by dragging the corners
   - You can also maximize the window for optimal viewing

4. **Graphics Drivers**
   - Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date

### Performance Problems

If the application feels slow or unresponsive:

1. **Check System Resources**
   - Close other applications to free up memory
   - Check for resource-intensive processes in Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (macOS), or System Monitor (Linux)

2. **Application Restart**
   - Close and restart the application to clear any memory issues

3. **System Restart**
   - Restart your computer to free up system resources

4. **Temporary Files**
